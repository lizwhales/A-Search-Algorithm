# A-Search-Algorithm
A* Search Algorithm implemented to print out a solution of coordinates which form the lowest path cost from start to goal. Reads in an input JSON file (see sample_input.json) for size "n" of board space, possible "blocks" on the board, a start and goal coordinates. To run program download and type: "python -m search sample_input.json" in command line.
